This script performs a complete data cleaning and preprocessing workflow on the Titanic dataset to prepare it for machine learning. It begins by loading the dataset using Pandas and displaying basic information like column types, descriptive statistics, and missing values. Missing values in the "Age" column are filled using the median, while missing "Embarked" values are filled with the most frequent category (mode). The "Cabin" column is dropped due to excessive missing data. Categorical variables like "Sex" and "Embarked" are converted into numerical format using one-hot encoding. Then, numerical features "Age" and "Fare" are standardized using `StandardScaler` to bring them onto a similar scale. A boxplot is used to visualize outliers in "Age" and "Fare", and outliers in "Fare" are removed using the interquartile range (IQR) method. This clean dataset can now be used for building accurate and reliable ML models.
